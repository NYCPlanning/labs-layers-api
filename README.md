{Replace this with a description of the application, customer, purpose, etc.}

{Replace this with a screenshot of the app.}

## Requirements

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
- {Replace this list with the app's dependencies.}

## Local development

- Clone this repo `command`
- Install Dependencies `command`
- Start the server `command`

## Architecture

{"Lay of the land" structure of the codebase, components...}

## Backend services

- {Replace this list with the app's backend service dependencies.}

## Testing and checks

- **ESLint** - We use ESLint with Airbnb's rules for JavaScript projects
  - Add an ESLint plugin to your text editor to highlight broken rules while you code
  - You can also run `eslint` at the command line with the `--fix` flag to automatically fix some errors.

- **Testing**
  - run `yarn test`

## Deployment

{Description of what type of hosting environmen is required, and steps for how Labs deploys -- e.g `git push dokku master`.}

## Sprites

The sprite sheet is generated by scripts that create a set of SVGs, then turn them into four files served in `public/static/`:
- `sprite.json`
- `sprite.png`
- `sprite@2x.json`
- `sprite@2x.png`

SVG files are output to `assets/sprite/svg/` by `assets/sprite/create-sprite-svgs.js`. Edit this file to change the automatically-created SVGs.
- Run `npm run create-sprite-svgs` to create the SVGs

The `.png` and `.json` files for Mapbox GL to consume are created with  [spritezero-cli](https://github.com/mapbox/spritezero-cli).
- If you haven't, install the command-line interface: `npm install -g @mapbox/spritezero-cli`
- Run the commands to generate the sprites at each resolution:
  - `spritezero public/static/sprite assets/sprite/svg/`
  - `spritezero public/static/sprite@2x assets/sprite/svg/ --ratio=2`
